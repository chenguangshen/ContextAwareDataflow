- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Given a block, evaluate that block inside the background Ruby thread at some time in the future, and then perform a Bloom tick. Because the block is evaluate inside the background Ruby thread, the block can safely examine Bud state. Note that calling sync_do blocks the caller until the block has been evaluated; for a non-blocking version, see async_do.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Note that the block is invoked after one Bud timestep has ended but before the next timestep begins. Hence, synchronous accumulation (&lt;=) into a Bud scratch collection in a callback is typically not a useful thing to do: when the next tick begins, the content of any scratch collections will be emptied, which includes anything inserted by a sync_do block using &lt;=. To avoid this behavior, insert into scratches using &lt;+."
