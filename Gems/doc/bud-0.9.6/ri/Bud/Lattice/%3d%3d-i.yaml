  body: "The default equality semantics for lattice objects is based on reveal. Note that this isn't always appropriate: if the intended equality semantics for the lattice type differ from the equality semantics of the object returned by reveal (e.g., a set lattice might return an array with an unpredictable order), the lattice type should override this behavior."
