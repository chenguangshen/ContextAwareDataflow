  body: Shutdown a Bud instance and release any resources that it was using. This method blocks until Bud has been shutdown. If <tt>stop_em</tt> is true, the EventMachine event loop is also shutdown; this will interfere with the execution of any other Bud instances in the same process (as well as anything else that happens to use EventMachine).
