- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Register a new callback. Given the name of a Bud collection, this method arranges for the given block to be invoked at the end of any tick in which any tuples have been inserted into the specified collection. The code block is passed the collection as an argument; this provides a convenient way to examine the tuples inserted during that fixpoint. (Note that because the Bud runtime is blocked while the callback is invoked, it can also examine any other Bud state freely.)
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Note that registering callbacks on persistent collections (e.g., tables, syncs and stores) is probably not wise: as long as any tuples are stored in the collection, the callback will be invoked at the end of every tick."
