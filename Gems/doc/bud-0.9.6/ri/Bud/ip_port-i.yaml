  body: Returns the IP and port of the Bud instance as a string. In addition to the local IP and port, the user may define an external IP and/or port. The external version of each is returned if available. If not, the local version is returned. There are use cases for mixing and matching local and external. local_ip:external_port would be if you have local port forwarding, and external_ip:local_port would be if you're in a DMZ, for example.
