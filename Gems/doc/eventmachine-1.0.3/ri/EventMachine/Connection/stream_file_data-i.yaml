- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Open a file on the filesystem and send it to the remote peer. This returns an object of type {EventMachine::Deferrable}. The object's callbacks will be executed on the reactor main thread when the file has been completely scheduled for transmission to the remote peer. Its errbacks will be called in case of an error (such as file-not-found). This method employs various strategies to achieve the fastest possible performance, balanced against minimum consumption of memory.
