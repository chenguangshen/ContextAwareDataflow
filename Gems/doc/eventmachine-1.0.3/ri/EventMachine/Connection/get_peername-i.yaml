  body: "This method is used with stream-connections to obtain the identity of the remotely-connected peer. If a peername is available, this method returns a sockaddr structure. The method returns nil if no peername is available. You can use Socket.unpack_sockaddr_in and its variants to obtain the values contained in the peername structure returned from #get_peername."
