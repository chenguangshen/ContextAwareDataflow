  body: Define a default catch-all for when the deferrables returned by work blocks enter a failed state. By default all that happens is that the resource is returned to the pool. If on_error is defined, this block is responsible for re-adding the resource to the pool if it is still usable. In other words, it is generally assumed that on_error blocks explicitly handle the rest of the lifetime of the resource.
