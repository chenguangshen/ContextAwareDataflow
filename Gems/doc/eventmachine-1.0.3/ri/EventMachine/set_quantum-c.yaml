- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: For advanced users. This function sets the default timer granularity, which by default is slightly smaller than 100 milliseconds. Call this function to set a higher or lower granularity. The function affects the behavior of {EventMachine.add_timer} and {EventMachine.add_periodic_timer}. Most applications will not need to call this function.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Avoid setting the quantum to very low values because that may reduce performance under some extreme conditions. We recommend that you not use values lower than 10.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This method only can be used if event loop is running.
