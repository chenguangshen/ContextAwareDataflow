- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Tells you whether the EventMachine reactor loop is currently running.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Useful when writing libraries that want to run event-driven code, but may be running in programs that are already event-driven. In such cases, if {EventMachine.reactor_running?} returns false, your code can invoke {EventMachine.run} and run your application code inside the block passed to that method. If this method returns true, just execute your event-aware code.
