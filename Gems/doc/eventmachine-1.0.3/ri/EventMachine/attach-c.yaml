- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Attaches an IO object or file descriptor to the eventloop as a regular connection. The file descriptor will be set as non-blocking, and EventMachine will process receive_data and send_data events on it as it would for any other connection.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: To watch a fd instead, use {EventMachine.watch}, which will not alter the state of the socket and fire notify_readable and notify_writable events instead.
