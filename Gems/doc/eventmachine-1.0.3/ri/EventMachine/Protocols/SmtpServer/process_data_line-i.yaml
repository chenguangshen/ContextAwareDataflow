- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Send the incoming data to the application one chunk at a time, rather than one line at a time. That lets the application be a little more flexible about storing to disk, etc. Since we clear the chunk array every time we submit it, the caller needs to be aware to do things like dup it if he wants to keep it around across calls.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Resets the transaction upon disposition of the incoming message. RFC5321 says this about the MAIL FROM command:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: " &quot;This command tells the SMTP-receiver that a new mail transaction is\n  starting and to reset all its state tables and buffers, including any\n  recipients or mail data.&quot;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Equivalent behaviour is implemented by resetting after a completed transaction.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: User-written code can return a Deferrable as a response from receive_message.
