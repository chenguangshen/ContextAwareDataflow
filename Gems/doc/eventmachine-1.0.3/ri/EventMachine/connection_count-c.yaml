- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns the total number of connections (file descriptors) currently held by the reactor. Note that a tick must pass after the 'initiation' of a connection for this number to increment. It's usually accurate, but don't rely on the exact precision of this number unless you really know EM internals.

  body: " EventMachine.run {\n   EventMachine.connect(&quot;rubyeventmachine.com&quot;, 80)\n   # count will be 0 in this case, because connection is not\n   # established yet\n   count = EventMachine.connection_count\n }\n"
