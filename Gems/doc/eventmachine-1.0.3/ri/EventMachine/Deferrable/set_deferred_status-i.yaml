- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Sets the &quot;disposition&quot; (status) of the Deferrable object. See also the large set of sugarings for this method. Note that if you call this method without arguments, no arguments will be passed to the callback/errback. If the user has coded these with arguments, then the user code will throw an argument exception. Implementors of deferrable classes <b>must</b> document the arguments they will supply to user callbacks.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "OBSERVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL here: you may call this method even on the INSIDE of a callback. This is very useful when a previously-registered callback wants to change the parameters that will be passed to subsequently-registered ones."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You may give either :succeeded or :failed as the status argument.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If you pass :succeeded, then all of the blocks passed to the object using the #callback method (if any) will be executed BEFORE the #set_deferred_status method returns. All of the blocks passed to the object using #errback will be discarded."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If you pass :failed, then all of the blocks passed to the object using the #errback method (if any) will be executed BEFORE the #set_deferred_status method returns. All of the blocks passed to the object using # callback will be discarded."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If you pass any arguments to #set_deferred_status in addition to the status argument, they will be passed as arguments to any callbacks or errbacks that are executed. It's your responsibility to ensure that the argument lists specified in your callbacks and errbacks match the arguments given in calls to #set_deferred_status, otherwise Ruby will raise an ArgumentError."
