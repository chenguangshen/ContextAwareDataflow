- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The is the responder for the loopback-signalled event. It can be fired either by code running on a separate thread ({EventMachine.defer}) or on the main thread ({EventMachine.next_tick}). It will often happen that a next_tick handler will reschedule itself. We consume a copy of the tick queue so that tick events scheduled by tick events have to wait for the next pass through the reactor core.
