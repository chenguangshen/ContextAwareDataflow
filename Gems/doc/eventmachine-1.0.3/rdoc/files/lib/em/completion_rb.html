      <h1>EM::Completion</h1>
<p>
A completion is a callback container for various states of completion. In
it&#8216;s most basic form it has a start state and a finish state.
</p>
<p>
This implementation includes some hold-back from the EM::Deferrable
interface in order to be compatible - but it has a much cleaner
implementation.
</p>
<p>
In general it is preferred that this implementation be used as a state
callback container than EM::DefaultDeferrable or other classes including
EM::Deferrable. This is because it is generally more sane to keep this
level of state in a dedicated state-back container. This generally leads to
more malleable interfaces and software designs, as well as eradicating
nasty bugs that result from abstraction leakage.
</p>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>
As already mentioned, the basic usage of a Completion is simply for its two
final states, :succeeded and :failed.
</p>
<p>
An asynchronous operation will complete at some future point in time, and
users often want to react to this event. API authors will want to expose
some common interface to react to these events.
</p>
<p>
In the following example, the user wants to know when a short lived
connection has completed its exchange with the remote server. The simple
protocol just waits for an ack to its message.
</p>
<pre>
   class Protocol &lt; EM::Connection
     include EM::P::LineText2

     def initialize(message, completion)
       @message, @completion = message, completion
       @completion.completion { close_connection }
       @completion.timeout(1, :timeout)
     end

     def post_init
       send_data(@message)
     end

     def receive_line(line)
       case line
       when /ACK/i
         @completion.succeed line
       when /ERR/i
         @completion.fail :error, line
       else
         @completion.fail :unknown, line
       end
     end

     def unbind
       @completion.fail :disconnected unless @completion.completed?
     end
   end

   class API
     attr_reader :host, :port

     def initialize(host = 'example.org', port = 8000)
       @host, @port = host, port
     end

     def request(message)
       completion = EM::Deferrable::Completion.new
       EM.connect(host, port, Protocol, message, completion)
       completion
     end
   end

   api = API.new
   completion = api.request('stuff')
   completion.callback do |line|
     puts &quot;API responded with: #{line}&quot;
   end
   completion.errback do |type, line|
     case type
     when :error
       puts &quot;API error: #{line}&quot;
     when :unknown
       puts &quot;API returned unknown response: #{line}&quot;
     when :disconnected
       puts &quot;API server disconnected prematurely&quot;
     when :timeout
       puts &quot;API server did not respond in a timely fashion&quot;
     end
   end
</pre>
<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
<p>
This completion implementation also supports more state callbacks and
arbitrary states (unlike the original Deferrable API). This allows for
basic stateful process encapsulation. One might use this to setup state
callbacks for various states in an exchange like in the basic usage
example, except where the applicaiton could be made to react to
&quot;connected&quot; and &quot;disconnected&quot; states additionally.
</p>
<pre>
   class Protocol &lt; EM::Connection
     def initialize(completion)
       @response = []
       @completion = completion
       @completion.stateback(:disconnected) do
         @completion.succeed @response.join
       end
     end

     def connection_completed
       @host, @port = Socket.unpack_sockaddr_in get_peername
       @completion.change_state(:connected, @host, @port)
       send_data(&quot;GET http://example.org/ HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n&quot;)
     end

     def receive_data(data)
       @response &lt;&lt; data
     end

     def unbind
       @completion.change_state(:disconnected, @host, @port)
     end
   end

   completion = EM::Deferrable::Completion.new
   completion.stateback(:connected) do |host, port|
     puts &quot;Connected to #{host}:#{port}&quot;
   end
   completion.stateback(:disconnected) do |host, port|
     puts &quot;Disconnected from #{host}:#{port}&quot;
   end
   completion.callback do |response|
     puts response
   end

   EM.connect('example.org', 80, Protocol, completion)
</pre>
<h2>Timeout</h2>
<p>
The Completion also has a timeout. The timeout is global and is not aware
of states apart from completion states. The timeout is only engaged if
timeout is called, and it will call fail if it is reached.
</p>
<h2>Completion states</h2>
<p>
By default there are two completion states, :succeeded and :failed. These
states can be modified by subclassing and overrding the completion_states
method. Completion states are special, in that callbacks for all completion
states are explcitly cleared when a completion state is entered. This
prevents errors that could arise from accidental unterminated timeouts, and
other such user errors.
</p>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>
Several APIs have been carried over from EM::Deferrable for compatibility
reasons during a transitionary period. Specifically cancel_errback and
cancel_callback are implemented, but their usage is to be strongly
discouraged. Due to the already complex nature of reaction systems, dynamic
callback deletion only makes the problem much worse. It is always better to
add correct conditionals to the callback code, or use more states, than to
address such implementaiton issues with conditional callbacks.
