# Getting started with Ruby <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> #
</p>
<p>
## About this guide ##
</p>
<p>
This guide is a quick tutorial that helps you to get started with <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> for writing
event-driven servers, clients and using it as a lightweight concurrency
library. It should take about 20 minutes to read and study the provided
code examples. This guide covers
</p>
<pre>
 * Installing EventMachine via [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org) and [Bundler](http://gembundler.com).
 * Building an Echo server, the &quot;Hello, world&quot;-like code example of network servers.
 * Building a simple chat, both server and client.
 * Building a very small asynchronous Websockets client.
</pre>
<p>
## Covered versions ##
</p>
<p>
This guide covers <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> v0.12.10 and 1.0
(including betas).
</p>
<p>
## Level ##
</p>
<p>
This guide assumes you are comfortable (but not necessary a guru) with the
command line. On Microsoft Windows™, we recommend you to use [JRuby](<a
href="http://jruby.org">jruby.org</a>) when running these examples.
</p>
<p>
## Installing <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> ##
</p>
<p>
### Make sure you have Ruby installed ###
</p>
<p>
This guide assumes you have one of the supported Ruby implementations
installed:
</p>
<pre>
 * Ruby 1.8.7
 * Ruby 1.9.2
 * [JRuby](http://jruby.org) (we recommend 1.6)
 * [Rubinius](http://rubini.us) 1.2 or higher
 * [Ruby Enterprise Edition](http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com)
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> works on
Microsoft Windows™.
</p>
<p>
### With Rubygems ###
</p>
<p>
To install the <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>
gem do
</p>
<pre>
    gem install eventmachine
</pre>
<p>
### With Bundler ###
</p>
<pre>
    gem &quot;eventmachine&quot;
</pre>
<p>
### Verifying your installation ###
</p>
<p>
Lets verify your installation with this quick IRB session:
</p>
<pre>
    irb -rubygems

    ruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 &gt; require &quot;eventmachine&quot;
     =&gt; true
    ruby-1.9.2-p180 :002 &gt; EventMachine::VERSION
     =&gt; &quot;1.0.0.beta.3&quot;
</pre>
<p>
## An Echo Server Example ##
</p>
<p>
Lets begin with the classic &quot;Hello, world&quot;-like example, an echo
server. The echo server responds clients with the same data that was
provided. First, here&#8216;s the code:
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/01_eventmachine_echo_server.rb}
</p>
<p>
When run, the server binds to port 10000. We can connect using Telnet and
verify it&#8216;s working:
</p>
<pre>
    telnet localhost 10000
</pre>
<p>
On my machine the output looks like:
</p>
<pre>
    ~ telnet localhost 10000
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
</pre>
<p>
Let&#8216;s send something to our server. Type in &quot;Hello, <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>&quot; and hit
Enter. The server will respond with the same string:
</p>
<pre>
    ~ telnet localhost 10000
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    Hello, EventMachine
    # (here we hit Enter)
    Hello, EventMachine
    # (this ^^^ is our echo server reply)
</pre>
<p>
It works! Congratulations, you now can tell your Node.js-loving friends
that you &quot;have done some event-driven programming, too&quot;. Oh, and
to stop Telnet, hit Control + Shift + ] and then Control + C.
</p>
<p>
Lets walk this example line by line and see what&#8216;s going on. These
lines
</p>
<pre>
    require 'rubygems' # or use Bundler.setup
    require 'eventmachine'
</pre>
<p>
probably look familiar: you use [RubyGems](<a
href="http://rubygems.org">rubygems.org</a>) (or [Bundler](<a
href="http://gembundler.com">gembundler.com</a>/)) for dependencies and
then require <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>
gem. Boring.
</p>
<p>
Next:
</p>
<pre>
    class EchoServer &lt; EventMachine::Connection
      def receive_data(data)
        send_data(data)
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Is the implementation of our echo server. We define a class that inherits
from {<a
href="../../classes/EventMachine/Connection.html">EventMachine::Connection</a>}
and a handler (aka callback) for one event: when we receive data from a
client.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> handles the
connection setup, receiving data and passing it to our handler,
{EventMachine::Connection#receive_data}.
</p>
<p>
Then we implement our protocol logic, which in the case of Echo is pretty
trivial: we send back whatever we receive. To do so, we&#8216;re using
{EventMachine::Connection#send_data}.
</p>
<p>
Lets modify the example to recognize `exit` command:
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/02_eventmachine_echo_server_that_recognizes_exit_command.rb}
</p>
<p>
Our `receive_data` changed slightly and now looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
    def receive_data(data)
      if data.strip =~ /exit$/i
        EventMachine.stop_event_loop
      else
        send_data(data)
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Because incoming data has trailing newline character, we strip it off
before matching it against a simple regular expression. If the data ends in
`exit`, we stop <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>
event loop with {<a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html#M000054">EventMachine.stop_event_loop</a>}.
This unblocks main thread and it finishes execution, and our little program
exits as the result.
</p>
<p>
To summarize this first example:
</p>
<pre>
 * Subclass {EventMachine::Connection} and override {EventMachine::Connection#send_data} to handle incoming data.
 * Use {EventMachine.run} to start EventMachine event loop and then bind echo server with {EventMachine.start_server}.
 * To stop the event loop, use {EventMachine.stop_event_loop} (aliased as {EventMachine.stop})
</pre>
<p>
Lets move on to a slightly more sophisticated example that will introduce
several more features and methods <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> has to offer.
</p>
<p>
## A Simple Chat Server Example ##
</p>
<p>
Next we will write a simple chat. Initially clients will still use telnet
to connect, but then we will add little client application that will serve
as a proxy between telnet and the chat server. This example is certainly
longer (~ 150 lines with whitespace and comments) so instead of looking at
the final version and going through it line by line, we will instead begin
with a very simple version that only keeps track of connected clients and
then add features as we go.
</p>
<p>
To set some expectations about our example:
</p>
<pre>
 * It will keep track of connected clients
 * It will support a couple of commands, à la IRC
 * It will support direct messages using Twitter-like @usernames
 * It won't use MongoDB, fibers or distributed map/reduce for anything but will be totally [Web Scale™](http://bit.ly/webscaletm) nonetheless. Maybe even [ROFLscale](http://bit.ly/roflscalevideo).
</pre>
<p>
### Step one: detecting connections and disconnectons ###
</p>
<p>
First step looks like this:
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/04_simple_chat_server_step_one.rb}
</p>
<p>
We see familiar {<a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html#M000045">EventMachine.run</a>} and
{<a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html#M000055">EventMachine.start_server</a>},
but also {EventMachine::Connection#post_init} and
{EventMachine::Connection#unbind} we haven&#8216;t met yet. We don&#8216;t
use them in this code, so when are they run? Like
{EventMachine::Connection#receive_data}, these methods are callbacks. <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> calls them when
certain events happen:
</p>
<pre>
 * {EventMachine#post_init} is called by the event loop immediately after the network connection has been established.
   In the chat server example case, this is when a new client connects.
 * {EventMachine#unbind} is called when client disconnects, connection is closed or is lost (because of a network issue, for example).
</pre>
<p>
All our chat server does so far is logging connections or disconnections.
What we want it to do next is to keep track of connected clients.
</p>
<p>
### Step two: keep track of connected clients ###
</p>
<p>
Next iteration of the code looks like this:
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/05_simple_chat_server_step_two.rb}
</p>
<p>
While the code we added is very straightforward, we have to clarify one
this first: subclasses of {<a
href="../../classes/EventMachine/Connection.html">EventMachine::Connection</a>}
are instantiated by <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> for every new
connected peer. So for 10 connected chat clients, there will be 10 separate
`SimpleChatServer` instances in our server process. Like any other objects,
they can be stored in a collection, can provide public API other objects
use, can instantiate or inject dependencies and in general live a happy
life all Ruby objects live until garbage collection happens.
</p>
<p>
In the example above we use a @@class_variable to keep track of connected
clients. In Ruby, @@class variables are accessible from instance methods so
we can add new connections to the list from `SimpleChatServer#post_init`
and remove them in `SimpleChatServer#unbind`. We can also filter
connections by some criteria, as `SimpleChatServer#other_peers
demonstrates`.
</p>
<p>
So, we keep track of connections but how do we identify them? For a chat
app, it&#8216;s pretty common to use usernames for that. Lets ask our
clients to enter usernames when they connect.
</p>
<p>
### Step three: adding usernames ##
</p>
<p>
To add usernames, we need to add a few things:
</p>
<pre>
 * We need to invite newly connected clients to enter their username.
 * A reader (getter) method on our {EventMachine::Connection} subclass.
 * An idea of connection state (keeping track of whether a particular participant had entered username before).
</pre>
<p>
Here is one way to do it:
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/06_simple_chat_server_step_three.rb}
</p>
<p>
This is quite an update so lets take a look at each method individually.
First, `SimpleChatServer#post_init`:
</p>
<pre>
    def post_init
      @username = nil
      puts &quot;A client has connected...&quot;
      ask_username
    end
</pre>
<p>
To keep track of username we ask chat participants for, we add @username
instance variable to our connection class. Connection instances are just
Ruby objects associated with a particular connected peer, so using @ivars
is very natural. To make username value accessible to other objects, we
added a reader method that was not shown on the snippet above.
</p>
<p>
Lets dig into `SimpleChatServer#ask_username`:
</p>
<pre>
    def ask_username
      self.send_line(&quot;[info] Enter your username:&quot;)
    end # ask_username

    # ...

    def send_line(line)
      self.send_data(&quot;#{line}\n&quot;)
    end # send_line(line)
</pre>
<p>
Nothing new here, we are using {EventMachine::Connection#send_data} which
we have seen before.
</p>
<p>
In `SimpleChatServer#receive_data` we now have to check if the username was
entered or we need to ask for it:
</p>
<pre>
    def receive_data(data)
      if entered_username?
        handle_chat_message(data.strip)
      else
        handle_username(data.strip)
      end
    end

    # ...

    def entered_username?
      !@username.nil? &amp;&amp; !@username.empty?
    end # entered_username?
</pre>
<p>
Finally, handler of chat messages is not yet implemented:
</p>
<pre>
    def handle_chat_message(msg)
      raise NotImplementedError
    end
</pre>
<p>
Lets try this example out using Telnet:
</p>
<pre>
    ~ telnet localhost 10000
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    [info] Enter your username:
    antares_
    [info] Ohai, antares_
</pre>
<p>
and the server output:
</p>
<pre>
    A client has connected...
    antares_ has joined
</pre>
<p>
This version requires you to remember how to terminate your Telnet session
(Ctrl + Shift + ], then Ctrl + C). It is annoying, so why don&#8216;t we
add the same `exit` command to our chat server?
</p>
<p>
### Step four: adding exit command and delivering chat messages ####
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/07_simple_chat_server_step_four.rb}
</p>
<p>
TBD
</p>
<p>
Lets test-drive this version. Client A:
</p>
<pre>
    ~ telnet localhost 10000
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    [info] Enter your username:
    michael
    [info] Ohai, michael
    Hi everyone
    michael: Hi everyone
    joe has joined the room
    # here ^^^ client B connects, lets greet him
    hi joe
    michael: hi joe
    joe: hey michael
    # ^^^ client B replies
    exit
    # ^^^ out command in action
    Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>
<p>
Client B:
</p>
<pre>
    ~ telnet localhost 10000
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    [info] Enter your username:
    joe
    [info] Ohai, joe
    michael: hi joe
    # ^^^ client A greets us, lets reply
    hey michael
    joe: hey michael
    exit
    # ^^^ out command in action
    Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>
<p>
And finally, the server output:
</p>
<pre>
    A client has connected...
    michael has joined
    A client has connected...
    _antares has joined
    [info] _antares has left
    [info] michael has left
</pre>
<p>
Our little char server now supports usernames, sending messages and the
`exit` command. Next up, private (aka direct) messages.
</p>
<p>
### Step five: adding direct messages and one more command ###
</p>
<p>
To add direct messages, we come up with a simple convention: private
messages begin with @username and may have optional colon before message
text, like this:
</p>
<pre>
    @joe: hey, how do you like eventmachine?
</pre>
<p>
This convention makes parsing of messages simple so that we can concentrate
on delivering them to a particular client connection. Remember when we
added `username` reader on our connection class? That tiny change makes
this step possible: when a new direct message comes in, we extract username
and message text and then find then connection for @username in question:
</p>
<pre>
    #
    # Message handling
    #

    def handle_chat_message(msg)
      if command?(msg)
        self.handle_command(msg)
      else
        if direct_message?(msg)
          self.handle_direct_message(msg)
        else
          self.announce(msg, &quot;#{@username}:&quot;)
        end
      end
    end # handle_chat_message(msg)

    def direct_message?(input)
      input =~ DM_REGEXP
    end # direct_message?(input)

    def handle_direct_message(input)
      username, message = parse_direct_message(input)

      if connection = @@connected_clients.find { |c| c.username == username }
        puts &quot;[dm] @#{@username} =&gt; @#{username}&quot;
        connection.send_line(&quot;[dm] @#{@username}: #{message}&quot;)
      else
        send_line &quot;@#{username} is not in the room. Here's who is: #{usernames.join(', ')}&quot;
      end
    end # handle_direct_message(input)

    def parse_direct_message(input)
      return [$1, $2] if input =~ DM_REGEXP
    end # parse_direct_message(input)
</pre>
<p>
This snippet demonstrates how one connection instance can obtain another
connection instance and send data to it. This is a very powerful feature,
consider just a few use cases:
</p>
<pre>
 * Peer-to-peer protocols
 * Content-aware routing
 * Efficient streaming with optional filtering
</pre>
<p>
Less common use cases include extending C++ core of <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> to provide access
to hardware that streams events that can be re-broadcasted to any
interested parties connected via TCP, UDP or something like AMQP or
WebSockets. With this, sky is the limit. Actually, <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> has several
features for efficient proxying data between connections. We will not cover
them in this guide.
</p>
<p>
One last feature that we are going to add to our chat server is the
`status` command that tells you current server time and how many people are
there in the chat room:
</p>
<pre>
    #
    # Commands handling
    #

    def command?(input)
      input =~ /(exit|status)$/i
    end # command?(input)

    def handle_command(cmd)
      case cmd
      when /exit$/i   then self.close_connection
      when /status$/i then self.send_line(&quot;[chat server] It's #{Time.now.strftime('%H:%M')} and there are #{self.number_of_connected_clients} people in the room&quot;)
      end
    end # handle_command(cmd)
</pre>
<p>
Hopefully this piece of code is easy to follow. Try adding a few more
commands, for example, the `whoishere` command that lists people currently
in the chat room.
</p>
<p>
In the end, our chat server looks like this:
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/08_simple_chat_server_step_five.rb}
</p>
<p>
We are almost done with the server but there are some closing thoughts.
</p>
<p>
### Step six: final version ###
</p>
<p>
Just in case, here is the final version of the chat server code we have
built:
</p>
<p>
{include:file:examples/guides/getting_started/03_simple_chat_server.rb}
</p>
<p>
### Step seven: future directions and some closing thoughts ###
</p>
<p>
The chat server is just about 150 lines of Ruby including empty lines and
comments, yet it has a few features most of chat server examples never add.
We did not, however, implement many other features that popular IRC clients
like [Colloquy](<a href="http://colloquy.info">colloquy.info</a>) have:
</p>
<pre>
 * Chat moderation
 * Multiple rooms
 * Connection timeout detection
</pre>
<p>
How would one go about implementing them? We thought it is worth discussing
what else <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> has to
offer and what ecosystem projects one can use to build a really
feature-rich Web-based IRC chat client.
</p>
<p>
With multiple rooms it&#8216;s more or less straightforward, just add one
more hash and a bunch of commands and use the information about which rooms
participant is in when you are delivering messages. There is nothing in <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> itself that can
make the job much easier for developer.
</p>
<p>
To implement chat moderation feature you may want to do a few things:
</p>
<pre>
 * Work with client IP addresses. Maybe we want to consider everyone who connects from certain IPs a moderator.
 * Access persistent data about usernames of moderators and their credentials.
</pre>
<p>
Does <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> have
anything to offer here? It does. To obtain peer IP address, take a look at
{EventMachine::Connection#get_peername}. The name of this method is a
little bit misleading and originates from low-level socket programming
APIs.
</p>
<p>
#### A whirlwind tour of the <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> ecosystem ####
</p>
<p>
To work with data stores you can use several database drivers that ship
with <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> itself,
however, quite often there are some 3rd party projects in the <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> ecosystem that have
more features, are faster or just better maintained. So we figured it will
be helpful to provide a few pointers to some of those projects:
</p>
<pre>
 * For MySQL, check out [em-mysql](https://github.com/eventmachine/em-mysql) project.
 * For PostgreSQL, have a look at Mike Perham's [EventMachine-based PostgreSQL driver](https://github.com/mperham/em_postgresql).
 * For Redis, there is a young but already popular [em-hiredis](https://github.com/mloughran/em-hiredis) library that combines EventMachine's non-blocking I/O with
   extreme performance of the official Redis C client, [hiredis](https://github.com/antirez/hiredis).
 * For MongoDB, see [em-mongo](https://github.com/bcg/em-mongo)
 * For Cassandra, Mike Perham [added transport agnosticism feature](http://www.mikeperham.com/2010/02/09/cassandra-and-eventmachine/) to the [cassandra gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/cassandra).
</pre>
<p>
[Riak](<a
href="http://www.basho.com/products_riak_overview.php">www.basho.com/products_riak_overview.php</a>)
and CouchDB talk HTTP so it&#8216;s possible to use [em-http-request](<a
href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-http-request">github.com/igrigorik/em-http-request</a>).
If you are aware of <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>-based non-blocking

#### Connection loss detection ####
</p>
<p>
Finally, connection loss detection. When our chat participant closes her
laptop lid, how do we know that she is no longer active? The answer is,
when <a href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> detects TCP
connectin closure, it calls {EventMachine::Connection#unbind}. Version
1.0.beta3 and later also pass an optional argument to that method. The
argument indicates what error (if any) caused the connection to be closed.

Failure and Recovery} guide.

#### What the Chat Server Example doesn&#8216;t demonstrate ####
</p>
<p>
This chat server also leaves out something production quality clients and
servers must take care of: buffering. We intentionally did not include any
buffering in our chat server example: it would only distract you from
learning what you really came here to learn: how to use <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> to build blazing
fast asynchronous networking programs quickly. However,
{EventMachine::Connection#receive_data} does not offer any guarantees that
you will be receiving &quot;whole messages&quot; all the time, largely
because the underlying transport (UDP or TCP) does not offer such
guarantees. Many protocols, for example, AMQP, mandate that large content
chunks are split into smaller <em>frames</em> of certain size. This means
that [amq-client](<a
href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-client">github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-client</a>)
library, for instance, that has <a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>-based driver, has
to deal with figuring out when exactly we received &quot;the whole
message&quot;. To do so, it uses buffering and employs various checks to
detect _frame boundaries_. So **don&#8216;t be deceived by the simplicity
of this chat example**: it intentionally leaves framing out, but real world
protocols usually require it.

## What to read next ##
</p>
<p>
The documentation is organized as a {file:docs/DocumentationGuidesIndex.md
number of guides}, covering all kinds of topics. TBD
</p>
<p>
## Tell us what you think! ##
</p>
<p>
Please take a moment and tell us what you think about this guide on the [<a
href="../../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> mailing list](<a
href="http://bit.ly/jW3cR3">bit.ly/jW3cR3</a>) or in the eventmachine
channel on irc.freenode.net: what was unclear? What wasn&#8216;t covered?
Maybe you don&#8216;t like the guide style or the grammar and spelling are
incorrect? Reader feedback is key to making documentation better.
