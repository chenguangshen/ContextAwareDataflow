# Summary

ContextAwareDataflow is a domain-specific language for building context-
aware mobile apps. It is a library based on the bloom-bud extension
of ruby, developed by several Ph.D. students from UC Berkeley.

See LICENSE for licensing information.

ContextAwareDataflow is developed by Kasturi Raghavan and Chenguang Shen
as the course project of CS 239 Winter 2013 at UCLA. For any questions,
contact Kasturi (kr@cs.ucla.edu) or Chenguang (cgshen@cs.ucla.edu).
